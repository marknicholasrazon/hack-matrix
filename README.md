# Hack Matrix

Hack Matrix is a prank tool that is designed to give the appearance that you are a hacker. It is not a real hacking tool and does not contain any harmful commands or scripts that could damage your computer. Instead, it is intended solely for the purpose of entertaining and fooling your friends into thinking that you have advanced hacking skills.

When you run Hack Matrix, it will display a series of simulated hacking commands on your screen, complete with a flashy interface and simulated terminal output. These commands are purely for show and do not actually do anything beyond providing a convincing visual display.

While Hack Matrix is a fun and harmless way to prank your friends, it is important to remember that real hacking is a serious crime that can have serious consequences. It is never okay to engage in unauthorized access to someone else's computer or network, and it is important to respect the law and the privacy of others.
